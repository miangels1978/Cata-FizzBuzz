### Description
 Program that prints a line for each number from 1 to 100:
- Usually just print the number itself.
- For multiples of three, print Fizz instead of the number
- For multiples of five print Buzzen instead of the number
- For numbers that are multiples of three and five, print FizzBuzz instead of the number.
- 
### Development
Main:
- Defines an object of the Class called Fizzbuzz.
- Defines a loop for printing numbers from 1 to 100.
- Includes a conditional within the loop to verify the multiples of 3 and 5.
- Call three methods to verify the conditional.

Texting
- Using the assertTrue() method, test whether the expected value of each method of the Fizzbuzz class is true or false.
